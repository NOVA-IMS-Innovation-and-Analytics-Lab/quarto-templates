# (1) Overview \

# Title

[The title of the software paper should focus on the software, e.g. “Text mining software from the X project”. If
the software is closely linked to a specific research paper, then “Software from Paper Title” is appropriate. The title should be
factual, relating to the functionality of the software and the area it relates to rather than making claims about the software,
e.g. “Easy-to-use”.]{.blue}

# Paper authors

[1. Last name, first name; (Lead/corresponding author first)]{.blue}\
[2. Last name, first name; etc.]{.blue}

# Paper author roles and affiliations

[1. First author role and affiliation]{.blue}\
[2. Second author role and affiliation etc.]{.blue}

# Abstract

[A short (ca. 100 word) summary of the software being described: what problem the software addresses, how it was
implemented and architected, where it is stored, and its reuse potential.]{.blue}

# Keywords

[keyword 1; keyword 2; etc.]{.blue}\
[Keywords should make it easy to identify who and what the software will be useful for.]{.blue}

# Introduction

[An overview of the software, how it was produced, and the research for which it has been used, including
references to relevant research articles. A short comparison with software which implements similar functionality should be
included in this section.]{.blue}

# Implementation and architecture

[How the software was implemented, with details of the architecture where relevant. Use of relevant diagrams is
appropriate. Please also describe any variants and associated implementation differences.]{.blue}

# Quality control

[Detail the level of testing that has been carried out on the code (e.g. unit, functional, load etc.), and in
which environments. If not already included in the software documentation, provide details of how a user could quickly understand
if the software is working (e.g. providing examples of running the software with sample input and output data).]{.blue}

# (2) Availability \

# Operating system

[Please include minimum version compatibility.]{.blue}

# Programming language

[Please include minimum version compatibility.]{.blue}

# Additional system requirements

[E.g. memory, disk space, processor, input devices, output devices.]{.blue}

# Dependencies

[E.g. libraries, frameworks, incl. minimum version compatibility.]{.blue}

# List of contributors

[Please list anyone who helped to create the software (who may also not be an author of this paper), including
their roles and affiliations.]{.blue}
